WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/s3665828/.conda/envs/cascade/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/array_ops.py:5049: calling gather (from tensorflow.python.ops.array_ops) with validate_indices is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
The `validate_indices` argument has no effect. Indices are always validated on CPU and never validated on GPU.
